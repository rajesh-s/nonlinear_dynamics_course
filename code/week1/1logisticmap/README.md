# Logistic Map

Write a simple program that uses a loop to compute a specified number n of iterates of the logistic map, starting from a specified initial condition x0, with a specified r parameter.  Your program should take n, x0, and r as inputs or arguments.  Check your program against the answer to the first problem above.

Using your program, compute the tenth iterate of the logistic map starting from x0 = 0.2, with r = 2.6.  What is the tenth iterate?  Again, choose the value that's closest to what your program produced.
