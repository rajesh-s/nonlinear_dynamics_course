# Code

The folders by week indicate module level programs/assignments written by me during the duration of the course.

The web app for Cobweb plots and Pendulum Simulation were provided by the instructor to aid in understanding the evolution of state space variables in dynamical systems. Archived it here as a standalone app for future reference in case the web links change. To open these, download the entire folder (that contains relevant web resources) and then open the .html file in a browser.
